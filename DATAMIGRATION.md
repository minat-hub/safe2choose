# Data Migration Plan from Google Analytics (Universal) to GA4:
Identify the data points that need to be captured: This includes all the important metrics, dimensions, and custom dimensions currently being collected through Universal Analytics.
Verify that GA4 has equivalent features: Ensure that GA4 has equivalent features to Universal Analytics so that the same data points can be captured.
Create a backup of the Universal Analytics data: This is to ensure that the data can be retrieved in case of any issues during the migration process.
Migrate the data to GA4: This can be done using the Google Analytics API, the Google Analytics Data Export API, or the GA4 measurement protocol. Ensure that data continuity is maintained by ensuring that the data is migrated in a consistent format.
Verify the accuracy of the data in GA4: Compare the data in GA4 with the data in Universal Analytics to ensure that the migration was successful and that the data is accurate.
Monitor the data in GA4: Set up monitoring to ensure that the data in GA4 continues to be accurate over time.
################
Identify the Universal Analytics account and property that needs to be migrated.
Review existing Universal Analytics tracking code and make sure all necessary data points are captured.
Test GA4 tracking code on a development website to ensure data accuracy.
Create a backup of Universal Analytics data to ensure data continuity.
Implement GA4 tracking code on live websites.
Continuously monitor GA4 data to ensure data accuracy and resolve any issues if necessary.
# Implementation of GA4 on the safe2choose.org website:
Setting up tags, triggers, and variables in Google Tag Manager: This includes creating tags to track pageviews, events, and user interactions on the website. Triggers are used to specify when the tags should fire and variables are used to store values that can be used across different tags.
Configuring GA4 settings: This includes setting up the GA4 property, creating a GA4 measurement ID, and configuring the GA4 data model.
Ensuring data accuracy: This includes ensuring that all the tags, triggers, and variables are properly configured and that the GA4 data model is configured to accurately track the data points that are important for the safe2choose.org website.
